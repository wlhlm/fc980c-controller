Leopold FC980C Replacement Controller
=====================================

This PCB replaces the controller of the Leopold FC980C keyboard to allow running
alternate firmware, especially open source firmware such as [QMK][QMK]. This
project relies heavily on the prior reverse engineering work done by hasu (aka
tmk) and collaborators.

This is the first PCB I have designed and as such I suspect this will have many
areas that can be improved. I am very much looking forward to hearing feedback
about this design, if you think something can be improved please open an issue
and let me know. I will list my reasons for various design choices below, as
well as an errata section to list shortcomings of the current design that I am
aware of.

(the resistor hand-soldered to the connector is due to a flaw of the revision 1
design, which has been fixed in revision 2)

**Specs:**
- STM32F401 MCU as found on the Blackpill boards
- Open Hardware licensed under CERN OHL-S v2
- designed to be assembled by [JLCPCB][JLC] (can of course be manufactured
  elsewhere, but board component selection has been optimized for JLC's
  component library)

**Why would anyone want a replacement keyboard controller for the FC980C?** In
case the original controller gets fried, the lack of controller replacement from
the manufacturer would otherwise mean tossing the whole (expensive) keyboard.
This board enables the usage of Free and Open Source firmware to replace the
proprietary stock firmware. Running alternate firmware allows enabling hardware
features not accessible through the original controller such as actuation point
adjustments, not to mention the plethora of software features enabled by QMK for
example.

Getting started
---------------

If you have received this controller fully assembled, your next step will be
firmware setup. Check the `firmware/` directory in this repository.

In case you still have to solder on the connectors, see the assembly section
below.

Assembly
--------

This PCB is intended to be manufactured and assembled by JLCPCB, **except** for
the connectors and a button on the back of the board, which most likely have to
be soldered on the PCB by hand.

The button (labled BOOT0) is through-hole and easily soldered by hand. Make sure
to place it on the bottom side, i.e. opposite side of the MCU, where the DIP
switches are on the original controller board.

The connector for the USB board (USB) is though-hole and can be hand-soldered.

The SWD header is optional and can be left unsoldered.

The connector labeled KEYBOARD is only available for surface mounting and
unfortunately not available at JLC for assembly (at least at the time of
design). Hand-soldering is a bit more challenging for this connector. Make sure
to use a healthy dose of flux and fine gauge solder wire.

Production
----------

While the PCB itself can be manufactured by a number of PCB houses, component
selection and SMD assembly is made with [JLCPCB][JLC] in mind. The
`jlcpcb/production_files` folder for each revision should include the necessary
BOM and CPL files in addition to the Gerbers. The board parameters are specified
in the PCB design file (the main parameters being a board thickness of 1.6mm and
2 copper layers). For the option "Remove Order Number", you can select "Specify
a location".

This board is compatible with JLC's "Economic PCBA" option. For option "Assembly
Side", choose "Top Side" and under "Tooling holes" you can specify "Added by
Customer".

The EEPROM (U4) and accompanying decoupling capacitor (C6) are optional. The
board should work without those populated.

Design review
-------------

The specific component selection is tailored to what was available at JLCPCB at
the time of design. While things like the capacitors and resistors can be easily
substituted, Larger ICs such as the USB protection, fuse, 3.3V regulator, and
MCU have not been evaluated for alternative parts.

The USB and KEYBOARD connectors interface with the existing connectors used in
the FC980C and cannot be substituted.

I don't intend to sell this controller PCB by myself and as such everyone who is
interested in the design is meant to order this directly from JLC for
themselves. As such, I've tried to minimize cost for low quantity production
runs. JLC has the concept of extended and basic parts where the former incurs a
one-time setup fee per production rund per component as those components require
additional labor for setting up the pick and place machines with the respective
components. I've tried to keep the number of extended components as low as
possible.

### MCU

The main requirements for the microcontroller were 5V tolerance and good
compatibility with QMK. I also tried to take pricing and availability for the
foreseeable future into account. My choice fell on the STM32F401 that is used in
the cheap "Blackpill" development boards. It is well supported by QMK and is
also used in [another Topre controller board project][RFR1Replacement] that
replaces the PCB of the Realforce R1 TKL keyboards.

### Protection circuitry

The 5V fuse and USB protection components have been carried forward from the
original RP2040-based design (revision 1) and have been taken from
[this][RP2040DesignGuide] RP2040 design guide.

### USB traces

USB trace width has been calculated using the KiCad built-in calculator
following a [guide on the Digikey blog][DigikeyUSBTraceGuide]. The wide traces
are caused by the board design having two layers and a thickness of 1.6mm.  This
is most likely overkill as the bandwidth requirements are very low for a
keyboard. Reviewing a number of other boards, none were using USB-specific trace
widths.

Errata
------

### Revision 2

None found thus far.

### Revision 1

The SWD header is unusable since SWDIO has been routed to the wrong pin on the
MCU (PA15 instead of PA13). This has no impact on the actual controller
functionality. Fixed in revision 2.

Unfortunately, the `KEY_STATE` pin is missing a 5V pull-up resistor. A manual
fix (such as soldering a 10k resistor between the `KEY_STATE` \[pin 14\] and 5V
pins on the `KEYBOARD` connector) is necessary. Fixed in revision 2.

Revisions
---------

### Revision 2

![rev2 PCB](img/rev2-board-render.png)

Updates SWD pinout to correctly use PA13 on the MCU for SWDIO instead of PA15.

Minor position adjustments to drill holes.

Adds 5V pull-up resistor to `KEY_STATE` line.

Removes I2C level shifter to simplify BOM.

**Sample tested and working:** not yetâ€”it is recommended to enable the options
"Confirm Production file" and "Confirm Parts Placement" when ordering from
JLC

### Revision 1

![rev1 PCB](img/rev1-board-photo.jpg)

First design that has a chance to actually work in the FC980C. Switch to a
STM32F401 microcontroller. This MCU allows saving a couple of components
compared to the RP2040, such as USB termination resistors and external flash.

One notable addition compared to the previous revision is an optional 64Kb
EEPROM.

**Sample tested and working:** tested and issues identified (see Errata
section), working with the suggested manual fixes

### Revision 0

![rev0 PCB](img/rev0-board-render.png)

The first version of this PCB uses a RP2040 controller. Unfortunately, the
FC980C electronics rely on the MCU being 5V tolerant. I have noticed this only
while triple checking the design *just* before submitting it for manufacturing.
The RP2040 is *not* 5V tolerant and would require level shifters on many I/O
lines. Because of that I decided to scrap the design and start anew, but since
the board design was pretty much complete, I'm including it in this repository
for posterity.

**Sample tested and working:** no

Acknowledgements
----------------

This replacement controller relies heavily on the [prior reverse engineering
work][GeekhackFC980CInvestigation] of the keyboard community, including
uncovering [schematics][FC660CSchematics] for the similar Leopold FC660C that
were submitted to the FCC that helped me figure out the I/O voltage
requirements. In particular, I want to thank hasu (aka tmk) who created a FC980C
replacement controller based on the ATmega32u4 MCU, publishing schematics and an
[open source firmware implementation][TMKFC980C] for tmk that has been
[ported][QMKFC980C] to QMK.

Thanks to Toocanzs#5098 from the QMK Discord for helping me with the crystal
load capacitor calculation.

The PCB has been designed using KiCad 6 and production files have been exported
using [Bouni's JLCPCB tools plugin][BouniJLCPlugin].
